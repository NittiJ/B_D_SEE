Yes, in Quest Analytics GeoAccess reports, the "Average Distance" columns represent the average distance to the nearest provider(s) for all employees in the group, regardless of whether they meet the access standard or not.

So in your screenshot:

For example, under Adult PCPs / 2 in 10 miles, the "Average Distance" of:

0.9 (1st nearest),

1.0 (2nd nearest), and

1.1 (3rd nearest)
â€¦is calculated across all 10,723 employees, not just the ones who have access.

This ensures a consistent baseline for comparing geographic proximity, even if the access threshold (e.g., 2 providers within 10 miles) is not met.

Let me know if you want help wording this clearly in an email to a broker or AM.
